# Spam-Classifier
    We get hundreds of messages daily nknown sources and our inbox is filled with unwanted emails/messages. These unwanted messages are called spam and essential messages are called ham mails. The Aim of the project is to prepare a model that will categorize messages as spam or ham. In order to achieve this, data from the messages is to be collected first and natural language processing techniques are to be applied on it. The spam filtering among messages helps the user to have a good visualization of the inbox. Unnecessary messages will be marked as spam so users need not waste their time reading them. The purpose of the project is to classify data in the messages as either spam (unwanted) or ham(wanted) messages using Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning.
